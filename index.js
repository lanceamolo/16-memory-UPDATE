// Have a "new game" screen with a single choice "new game"
// The game should have a total of 9 pairs (18 cards total)
// When the user runs out of turns, show a losing screen
// When the user finds a match, leave the cards face up and disallow clicking those cards
// When the chooses two cards that do not match, flip them back over
// When the user wins or loses, indicate as much
// All screens should be generated via JavaScript templates

// First priority!
// Focus on getting the actual game to work first! Then focus on the next feature.
// Understand how cards turn with just CSS and HTML
